## Machine Learning System

The `MLSystem` class implements the core machine learning logic. It extracts features from number sequences, predicts the pattern type using weighted scores, and learns from user results to adjust its predictions. The system uses a combination of statistical features (mean, variance) and pattern-specific indicators (arithmetic, geometric, quadratic, exponential) to make predictions. It updates its weights based on the user's success rate, effectively learning and improving over time.

## Learning Path

The `LearningPath` class manages the user's learning journey. It tracks the user's progress, generates new challenges, and provides personalized recommendations. The learning path is divided into levels, and users gain experience points by completing challenges. The system monitors the user's performance across different pattern types and suggests areas where they need to focus their practice.

## Challenge Generation

The `generateChallenge` method creates new challenges with varying sequence lengths and pattern types.  The sequences are designed to be challenging yet solvable, and the pattern types are randomly selected to provide a diverse training experience. The `nextNumber` is calculated based on the chosen `patternType`.

## Future Enhancements

- **More Pattern Types:** Add support for more complex patterns, such as Fibonacci sequences, trigonometric patterns, and custom patterns.
- **Difficulty Levels:** Implement explicit difficulty levels to allow users to choose their desired challenge level.
- **Visualizations:**  Incorporate charts and graphs to visualize user progress and performance over time.
- **User Accounts:**  Allow users to create accounts to save their progress and preferences.
- **Leaderboards:**  Implement leaderboards to foster friendly competition and motivation.
- **Adaptive Learning Rate:** Dynamically adjust the learning rate of the ML system based on user performance.
- **Explanations:** Provide detailed explanations of the patterns and solutions for each challenge.
- **Gamification:** Integrate game-like elements, such as badges and rewards, to enhance engagement.
